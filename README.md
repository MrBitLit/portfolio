# portfolio
My personal portfolio website where you can learn anything about me and my skills.

The website was built using react.js with JSX. I also used SCSS to improve and simplify my CSS code. I also used React Bootstrap and some other libraries to improve the design of my website and to write my code faster and more efficiently.
